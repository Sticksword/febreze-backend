Michael: You know, *I really miss the Caribbean*.

Jeff: Why's that?

Michael: I went last summer with my girlfriend and some of our friends. *It was such an amazing experience, the smell of the ocean, the sound of the waves. I really wish I could go back... in fact, I bought a Febreze air freshener the other day just to replicate the smell of the ocean. Weird right?*

Jeff: Wait actually no it's not. I have been making this IoT app called Amelia that connects your Android phone with ordinary household appliances. Maybe I could hook it up with your new Febreze air freshener. Wait you also have a Nest thermostat right? My app can also hook up to that! It's *very modular (and interoperable)*.

Michael: Wait really? That's pretty cool! Can we try it out and see?

Jeff: Yeah sure, let me show you.

* turn to show audience the app *

Jeff: So this is the main screen of the app. It shows you all of the places you can visit. Here's the Caribbean!

Michael: Wow! Saint Martin! I was there.

Jeff: Let's revisit!

* clicks Saint Martin *

Jeff: From here, you can see what the *live weather conditions* are like. It seems that weather conditions are pretty nice so let's visit. We wouldn't want to if it was raining.

* clicks big round button *

Jeff: Bam!

Michael: Wow! So I just have to wait a few minutes and it will smell and sound like Saint Martin?

Jeff: Yup.

Michael: Damn.. this brings me back. *The memories!!* The smell.. the sound.. you even made it more humid!
Michael: Hold on a second. You said it's modular right? I have an Amazon Echo. Do you think I can connect Alexa to your app?

Jeff: Hmm yeah I think so. Let me get back to you.

* one day later *

Jeff: Hey Michael! So I did a bit of tweaking here and there and you can connect Alexa to my app now.

Michael: Awesome, can we try it out!

Jeff: Let's go! This time, let's go to some place different.

* turn to Alexa *

Jeff: Alexa, ask Amelia to bring us to Sichuan National Park.

Alexa: Ok sure.

Jeff: Aaaaaaand we're here!

Michael: *looks surprised*
Michael: This is so peaceful! I could read a book in this.. or finish building my project. Anything, really. This is such a serene atmosphere. This environment *helps me focus*.

* Alexa runs in background *

Jeff: So you have any other suggestions like Alexa integration? *Future features*, perhaps?

Michael: Hmm.. it would be cool if I could have me some of that delicious Caribbean food.

Jeff: Hmm.. so like, cater some food from that location to your house?

Michael: Yeah that would be sick.

Jeff: You know what I could also do.

Michael: What?

Jeff: I wanted to build a recommendation engine. Imagine if Amelia suggested places similar to the ones you've been to. Great for future vacation planning.
